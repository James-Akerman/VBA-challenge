# Stock Market Analysis

## Overview of the Project
A VBA script which analyses three years worth of stock data from 2014 to 2016. 
It then calculates the following for each stock
- the yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- the percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- the total stock volume of the stock.

I also calculates which stock showed the greatest increase, decrease, and change in trading volume for that year.
